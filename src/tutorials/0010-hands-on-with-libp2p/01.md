In the [Introduction to libp2p Tutorial][intro-libp2p-tutorial], we learned that libp2p helps us build _peer-to-peer_ applications that don't depend on centralized servers.

Generally speaking, a "peer" is a single participant in a peer-to-peer system. Each peer is
represented by a piece of software running on a user's device, and peers can talk directly to one another
without having to go through a central server first.

In this lesson, we'll get familiar with some of the core capabilities of a libp2p peers by looking at the
main libp2p "node" interface.
